# On Premises Server

These instructions cover installing and configuring an agent to connect to your on premises Team Foundation Server 2015 or later.  We recommend having the latest quarterly update installed.

## Configure Server for Basic + SSL

Basic Auth is required for OSX/Linux Access.  
Ensure ssl/https to secure the communicattion channel since basic credentials in the clear over the network.

[Instructions Here](https://github.com/Microsoft/tfs-cli/blob/master/docs/configureBasicAuth.md)

## Account and Roles

Determine the local or domain user to use.  Add to *both* pool roles:

  1. Agent Pool Administrators (allows to register)
  2. Agent Pool Service Accounts (allows listening to build queue)

![Agent Roles](roles.png "Agent Roles")

Then add the account to the collection level "Project Collection Build Service Accounts" group for any collections it will build.

## Install

By Installing the agent, you are accepting the terms on the [Team Explorer Everywhere EULA](teeeula.md)  

Running this from the command line (terminal) will download prereqs, install/update the agent bits globally and create an agent in your current directory.  Make a new directory for your agent

> Tips 
> Directory should be created under the users home directory (~).  
> Prefer running the agent as the logged in user and creating under ~ will minimize permission issues.

Copy and paste the curl line.  If your linux box does not have curl [follow this answer](http://askubuntu.com/questions/259681/the-program-curl-is-currently-not-installed)

From a terminal:
```bash
mkdir myagent
cd myagent

curl -skSL https://aka.ms/xplatagent | bash
```
Your output should look [similar to this](sampleoutput.md)

If you have issues with this, fully realized zips are available.

Go to the [releases section on github](https://github.com/Microsoft/vso-agent/releases) and download the linux or OSX (Darwin) package.

### Configure on first run

>> TIPS:
>> IMPORTANT: for TFS, ensure you answer true (not the default) for force basic
>> Ensure it's server level url (no collection)
>> If the agent isn't configured (.agent file exists), on first run, it will configure.

```bash
$ ./run.sh
Enter alternate username > yourusername
Enter alternate password > yourpassword
Enter agent name (enter sets yourmac.local)  > 
Enter agent pool name (enter sets default)  > 
Enter poolName(enter sets default) > 
Enter serverUrl > http://mytfsserver:8080/tfs
...
Enter force basic (enter is false)  > true
Config saved
Waiting ...
```

An agent is now running interactively.  ctrl-c will exit the agent.

## Update Existing Agent

Run the same command used to install from the agent root directory (package.json will be in that folder)

Before updating stop the agent (ctrl-c if interactive, if service [see run as a service](service.md))

From a terminal:
```bash
curl -skSL https://aka.ms/xplatagent | bash
```
Your output should look [similar to this](sampleoutput.md)

## Run as a Service

Running interactively is good for testing and evaluation.  But, in production the agent should be run as a service
to ensure the agent survives reboots.

## Agents without Internet Access

If you have Server and Agent without internet access, it's possible to download and agent to a thumbdrive from a computer that has internet access (you need it to download :)) and then then use that to stamp out agents on your private network agent machines.

Go to the [releases section on github](https://github.com/Microsoft/vso-agent/releases) and download the linux or OSX (Darwin) package.
