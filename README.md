# Microsoft VSTS Cross Platform Build & Release Agent

A cross platform build agent for Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Team Foundation Server (TFS).  Supported on Mac OSX and Linux.

> NOTICE: This agent will soon be replaced with a single open sourced cross platform agent for Windows, OSX and Linux written in CoreCLR.  This agent is still supported but many of the limitations and pending features for this agent are being written into the new agent from the start.  [See more here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-agent/blob/master/README.md).  We will triage every issue and ensure it's in the new agent or moved over.
