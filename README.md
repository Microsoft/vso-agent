# Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services  Cross-platform Build & Release Agent

A cross-platform build agent for Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Team Foundation Server (TFS).  Supported on Mac OSX and Linux.

> NOTICE: This agent will soon be replaced with a single, open-sourced, cross-platform agent for Windows, OSX and Linux developed for [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io/).  This agent is still supported, but many of the limitations and pending features for this agent are being written into the new agent from the start.  [See more here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-agent/blob/master/README.md).  We will ensure every issue is implemented in the new agent or transferred to its repo.
